/========
HIGH
---- needed for the program to function for proof-of-concept and further testing:
=========

✓ System can serve questionnaires to patient

✓ Questions may be asked in multiple formats

☐ System should send notices of application errors

☐ Completed questionnaires should be scored

☐ System should have unit testing



/========
HIGH BUT WITH AN ASTERISK
---- high importance, but would be completed in stages when the project is in a more stable condition and not in one work day, day one
=========

☐ Documentation should be created for the end user

☐ Documentation should be created on questionnaire creation



/========
MEDIUM
---- important, but requires the framework to function in order to implement
=========

☐ System should have robust logging system

☐ Patients need to login to an account to answer questionnaires

☐ Patient responses to questions are stored for later review

☐ Scores should be displayed at the end of the questionnaire(s)
-- lower priority, but tied to above list item

✓ Patients should be presented with a welcome screen prior to the first questionnaire

✓ Patients should only see and respond to one question at a time
-- implement as part of high-priority list item

✓ Patients should be allowed to go back and modify a response

☐ Patients should be able to decline the questionnaire at any point

☐ Patients should be allowed to skip questions

☐ Multiple questionnaires can be done consecutively

☐ Questionnaire analytics should be stored

☐ Questionnaires should be assigned based on patient demographics



/========
REGULATORY
---- important, but easier to implement in stages when the project is in a more stable condition and not on work day one
=========

☐ Code should follow Microsoft's C# guidelines

☐ Code should follow proper MVC principles

☐ Code formatting should be separated into a Data, Business, and Presentation layer

☐ User Interface needs to be responsive
-- arguably low priority but not nearly as low as the other Lows so it goes here



/========
LOW PRIORITY
---- quality of user experience, but not necessary to implement until the project actually works
=========

☐ Patients should see a progress bar

☐ A loading animation should appear on page transitions
